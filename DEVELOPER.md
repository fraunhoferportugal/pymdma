# Developer Notes

This project uses [Conda](https://anaconda.org/anaconda/python) to manage Python virtual environments and [Poetry](https://python-poetry.org/) as the main dependency manager. The project is structured as a Python src package, with the main package located in the `pymdma` folder.

There are three main modalities: `image`, `time_series`, and `tabular`. Each modality has its own folder/submodule in the `pymdma` package. The `general` and `common` modules contain the main classes definitions used in the API and on the package version of the project.

Each modality dependency is defined as an extra in the [pyproject](pyproject.toml) configuration file. Development dependencies are defined as poetry groups in the same file. More information about packaging and dependencies can be found below.

The `scripts` folder contains shell scripts that can be used to automate common tasks. You can find some examples of execution in this folder. Additionally, the `notebooks` folder contains Jupyter notebooks with examples of how to import and use the package.

We also provide a docker image to run a REST API version of the repository. The docker image is built using the [Dockerfile](Dockerfile) in the root of the repository.

A coding standard is enforced using [Black](https://github.com/psf/black), [isort](https://pypi.org/project/isort/) and
[Flake8](https://flake8.pycqa.org/en/latest/). Python 3 type hinting is validated using
[MyPy](https://pypi.org/project/mypy/).

Unit tests are written using [Pytest](https://docs.pytest.org/en/latest/), documentation is written
using [Numpy Style Python Docstring](https://numpydoc.readthedocs.io/en/latest/format.html).
[Pydocstyle](http://pydocstyle.org/) is used as static analysis tool for checking compliance with Python docstring
conventions.

Additional code security standards are enforced by [Safety](https://github.com/pyupio/safety) and
[Bandit](https://bandit.readthedocs.io/en/latest/). [Git-secrets](https://github.com/awslabs/git-secrets)
ensure you're not pushing any passwords or sensitive information into your Bitbucket repository.
Commits are rejected if the tool matches any of the configured regular expression patterns that indicate that sensitive
information has been stored improperly.

We use [mkdocs](https://www.mkdocs.org)  with the [Numpydocs](https://numpydoc.readthedocs.io/en/latest/format.html) style for building documentation. More information on how to build the documentation can be found below.

## Prerequisites

Nearly all prerequisites are managed by Conda. All you need to do is make sure that you have a working Python 3
environment and install miniconda itself. Conda manages `virtualenvs` as well. Typically, on a project that uses virtualenv
directly you would activate the virtualenv to get all the binaries that you install with pip onto the path.
Conda works in a similar way but with different commands.

Use miniconda for your python environments (it's usually unnecessary to install full anaconda environment, miniconda
should be enough). It makes it easier to install some dependencies, like `cudatoolkit` for GPU support. It also allows you
to access your environments globally.

Example installation:

```bash
wget https://repo.anaconda.com/miniconda/Miniconda3-latest-Linux-x86_64.sh
bash Miniconda3-latest-Linux-x86_64.sh
```

## Environment Setup
We recommend you install [Conda](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/) (or similar) to manage your Python versions in your computer. After which, you can create a new environment with the following commands:

```shell
conda env create -f environment.yml # create from configuration
conda activate da_metrics # activate virtual environment
```

To start developing, you should install the project dependencies and the pre-commit hooks. You can do this by running the following command (poetry and gcc are required):

```shell
make setup-all # install dependencies
source .venv-dev/bin/activate # activate the virtual environment
make install-dev-all # install development tools
```

Alternatively, you can install the dependencies manually by running the following commands:

```shell
(da_metrics) python -m venv .venv # you can use any other name for the venv
(da_metrics) source activate .venv/bin/activate # activate the venv you just created
(da_metrics) poetry install --all-extras --with dev # install all dependencies
(da_metrics) poetry run pre-commit install --install-hooks -t pre-commit -t commit-msg
```



## Packaging and Dependencies

This project uses [Conda](https://anaconda.org/anaconda/python) to manage Python virtual environments and [Poetry](https://python-poetry.org/) as the main packaging and dependency manager.

Poetry allows to organize the dependencies into groups so you can isolate and optimize the dependency trees for different purposes. A dependency can be added with:

```
poetry add <package>
```

### Dependency Groups
To add a dependency into a specific group, use:

```
poetry add <package> --group <group>
```

A dependency group can be made optional (i.e. not installed by default unless explicitly included) can be done by adding the following into `pyproject.toml` file above the group dependencies:

```
[tool.poetry.group.<group>]
optional = true
[tool.poetry.group.<group>.dependencies]
...
```

Poetry allows for more advanced specification of dependencies, such as version ranges, git repositories, etc. For more information, please refer to the [Poetry documentation](https://python-poetry.org/docs/dependency-specification/).

A group of dependencies can be installed with:

```
# Installs non-optional dependencies and dependencies in the with parameter
poetry install --with <group>,<group>,...
```

It's also possible to install a single group isolated with:

```
poetry install --only <group>,<group>,...
```

### Extra Dependencies
To add an extra dependency, use:
```
poetry add <package> --extras <extra>
```

To install the extra dependencies, use:
```
poetry install --extras <extra>
```
Note that `<extra>` is the name of the extra dependencies group or a space separated list of extra dependencies.


A list of all dependencies can be found in the [pyproject.toml](pyproject.toml) configuration file.


## Git Hooks

We rely on [pre-commit](https://pre-commit.com) hooks to ensure that the code is properly-formatted, clean, and type-safe when it's checked in.
The `run install` step described below installs the project pre-commit hooks into your repository. These hooks
are configured in [`.pre-commit-config.yaml`](/.pre-commit-config.yaml). After installing the development requirements
and cloning the package, run

```
pre-commit install
```

from the project root to install the hooks locally.  Now before every `git commit ...` these hooks will be run to verify
that the linting and type checking is correct. If there are errors, the commit will fail, and you will see the changes
that need to be made. Alternatively, you can run pre-commit

```
pre-commit run  
```

If necessary, you can temporarily disable a hook using Git's `--no-verify` switch. However, keep in mind that the CI
build enforces these checks, so the build will fail.

You can build your own pre-commit scripts. Put them on `scripts` folder. To make a shell script executable, use the
following command.

```
git update-index --chmod=+x scripts/name_of_script.sh
```

Donâ€™t forget to commit and push your changes after running it!

**Warning:** You need to run `git commit` with your conda environment activated. This is because by default the packages used
by pre-commit are installed into your project's conda environment. (note: `pre-commit install --install-hooks` will install
the pre-commit hooks in the currently active environment).

### Markdown

Local links can be written as normal, but external links should be referenced at the  bottom of the Markdown file for clarity.
For example:

```md
Use a local link to reference the [`README.md`](../README.md) file, but an external link for [Fraunhofer AICOS][fhp-aicos].

[fhp-aicos]: https://www.fraunhofer.pt/
```

We also try to wrap Markdown to a line length of 88 characters. This is not strictly
enforced in all cases, for example with long hyperlinks.

## Testing

\[Tests are written using the `pytest` framework\]\[pytest\], with its configuration in the `pyproject.toml` file.
Note, only tests in `pymdma/tests` folders folder are run.
To run the tests, enter the following command in your terminal:

```shell
pytest -vvv
```

### Code coverage

\[Code coverage of Python scripts is measured using the `coverage` Python package\]\[coverage\]; its configuration
can be found in `pyproject.toml`.
To run code coverage, and view it as an HTML report, enter the following command in your terminal:

```shell
coverage run -m pytest
coverage html
```

or use the `make` command:

```shell
make coverage-html
```

The HTML report can be accessed at `htmlcov/index.html`.

## Generating Documentation
The documentation is written in Markdown and follows the [Numpy Style Python Docstring](https://numpydoc.readthedocs.io/en/latest/format.html) format. All documentation source files is in the `docs` folder. To build the documentation, run the following commands:

```shell
make mkdocs-build # build the documentation
make mkdocs-serve # serve the documentation locally
```

The documentation will be built in the `docs/_build` folder. The default link to access the documentation is `http://localhost:8000`.

## Docker Encapsulation
We developed a Docker image to encapsulate the REST API server version of the repository, for internal use. The server is built using the [FastAPI](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/) framework. A list of frozen dependencies can be found in [requirements-prod.txt](requirements/requirements-prod.txt). The image is built from the [Dockerfile](Dockerfile) in the root of the repository.

To build the Docker image, run the following command:

```shell
docker build -t pymdma .
```

To run the Docker image, run the following command:

```shell
docker run -d -p 8080:8000 -v ./data/:/app/data/ pymdma
```
This will start the server on port `8080` in the host machine and mount the `data` folder in the container. The server documentation can be accessed at `http://localhost:8080/docs`. Dataset files should be placed in the data folder to be accessed by the server. You should follow the current structure of datasets in the data


## Set private environment variables in .envrc file

System specific variables (e.g. absolute paths to datasets) should not be under version control, or it will result in
conflict between different users. Your private keys also shouldn't be versioned since you don't want them to be leaked.

The .env file, which serves as an example. Create a new file called .env (this name is excluded from version control in
.gitignore). You should use it for storing environment variables like this:

```
MY_VAR=/home/user/my_system_path
```

All variables from .env are loaded in config.py automatically.

If you have [direnv](https://direnv.net/docs/installation.html) correctly configured, when entering the directory of this project through the command line interface the conda environment and the virtual environment should be automatically activated. If this does not work, try running `$ direnv allow`, cd out of the directory and then cd into the directory again; the identification of the two activated environments should appear to the left of the terminal (not always the case when using VS Code).


<!-- ## CI

All PRs trigger a CI job to run linting, type checking, tests, and build docs. The CI script is located [here](Jenkinsfile)
and should be considered the source of truth for running the various development commands. -->

## Line Endings

The [`.gitattributes`](.gitattributes) file controls line endings for the files in this repository.



## IDE Setup

There are a few useful plugins that are probably available for most IDEs. Using Pycharm, you'll want to install the
black plugin.

- [blackconnect](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/14321-blackconnect) can be configured to auto format files on save.
  Just run `make blackd` from a shell to set up the server and the plugin will do its thing. You need to configure it to
  format on save, it's off by default.

## Development Details

You can run `make help` for a full list of targets that you can run. These are the ones that you'll need most often.

```bash
# For running tests locally
make test

# For formatting and linting
make lint
make format
make format-fix

# Remove all generated artifacts
make clean
```

## Reproducible environment

The first step in reproducing an analysis is always reproducing the computational environment it was run in.
**You need the same tools, the same libraries, and the same versions to make everything play nicely together.**

By listing all of your requirements in the repository you can easily track the packages needed to recreate the analysis,
but what tool should we use to do that?

Whilst popular for scientific computing and data-science, [conda](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/) poses problems for collaboration and packaging:

- It is hard to reproduce a conda-environment across operating systems
- It is hard to make your environment "pip-installable" if your environment is fully specified by conda

### Files

Due to these difficulties, we recommend only using conda to create a virtual environment and list dependencies not available through usage of Poetry.

- `environment.yaml` - Defines the base conda environment and any dependencies not managed by Poetry.
- `pyproject.toml` - This is the preferred way to specify dependencies. If you need to add a dependency, chances are it goes here!
- `requirements/` - Folder containing requirements files in case the environment where the code is deployed can't run Poetry. These can be generated via Poetry or using the `Makefile` rules provided.
