# Tutorial Schedule and Location

The ECML PKDD 2025 conference will be held in the city of **Porto, Portugal** from **15 to 19 Setember 2025**.

This specific tutorial will take place at the **15th of September** at **14h00**. The tutorial will take about **4 hours**, including a **30 min break**. The first part of the tutorial will be a presentation of the library and its metrics. The remaining time will be dedicated to hands-on sessions focused on each data modality. A detailed schedule is provided bellow.
